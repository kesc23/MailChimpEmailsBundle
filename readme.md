# MailChimp Emails - by Kesc23

## Get your emails from MailChimp and bring them to Mautic

Bring your emails from MailChimp without having to create various themes inside mautic.

One of the problems I faced that made me create this plugin was that GrapeJs emails don't look good in Gmail and while I was designing my emails in MailChimp, i had to grab the HTML from the preview and create a new Theme all the time!

It wasn't not only unnefficient as it was a mess in the themes folder.

So i decided to visit MailChimp API and bring this marvelous tool for me and you!
